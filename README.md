Derivatives are one of the most complex financial products. But what actually makes them complex?

•Derived value from the underlying asset. 
•Key role in hedging, speculation, or arbitrage.
•Dealing with both over-the-counter & exchange traded products. 

Instead of jumping straight into fancy models like Black-Scholes. To ground my learning, I sourced real data from NSE and supported reports from SEBI- two major regulatory bodies supervising the Derivatives Market. Together, they monitor volatility and liquidity, publish data for month and yearly no. of contracts, and track turnover– across segments. 

The four major segments in Derivatives, NSE diversify into:
📈 Equity Derivatives –The oldest & biggest segment in size –started in 2000.

🌾Commodity Derivatives- started in 2018 on NSE. 

💱Currency Derivatives –NSE started Exchange-traded currency futures in 2008. 

🏦Interest Rate Derivatives–OTC dominance draws out liquidity- started in 2009.
